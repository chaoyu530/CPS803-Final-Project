## Abstract
- The project explores the implementation of multiple models for the multiple classifications of images by studying the classification of animals. For the ten-class dataset used, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was eventually used to obtain a success rate close to 80%. We also tried other algorithms in the project, and their classification accuracy fluctuated between about 20 and 50 percent. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms, the project summarized the characteristics of the different algorithms.
