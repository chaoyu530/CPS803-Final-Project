## Abstract
- The project explores the implementation of multiple models for the multiple classifications of images by studying the classification of animals. For the ten-class dataset used, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was eventually used to obtain a success rate close to 80%. We also tried other algorithms in the project, and their classification accuracy fluctuated between about 20 and 50 percent. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms, the project summarized the characteristics of the different algorithms. 

## Dataset
- For the selection of the dataset, through the project [“Animal-10” powered by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10), a total of 10 different animal datasets was selected
- Dataset was divided into two subsets with different numbers of images:    
    - subsets of size 500 and 1000 respectively for each animal category 
    - ratio of training data to validation data is 8:2

## Methodology
+ K-nearest neighbours Algorithm
+ Convolutional neural network
+ Naive Bayes with feature extraction
+ Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network
+ Support Vector Machine with SIFT
